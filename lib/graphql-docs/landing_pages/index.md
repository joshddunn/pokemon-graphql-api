# PokeQL (beta)

PokeQL is a GraphQL API for the Pokemon video games.

The documentation for PokeQL is incomplete, but is currently being worked on.

This API is in *beta* so endpoints and structure may change without notice.

Requests should be made to

    `https://pokeql.com/v1`

You can test queries [here](https://pokeql.com/graphiql).
